No Strings Attached is a web-based graphics demo inspired by the 1993 demo [Second Reality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Reality). It is written in pure JavaScript and uses mathematical transformations to animate DOM elements.

This demo was originally released in 2009 and has since been made open source under the MIT license.
